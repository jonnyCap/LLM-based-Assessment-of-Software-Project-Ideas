Globetracker Travel Management Application</p>

<p><b>Project Overview:</b></p>

<p>Globetracker is a travel
management application designed to revolutionize the way travelers plan, book,
and track their journeys. Our client envisions an iOS and Android application
that functions as a one-stop solution for all travel-related tasks, catering to
the needs of both leisure and business travellers. The aim of this app is to
enable users to easily book a trip from the start to the end, without any
difficulties or problems. Users will find everything they need regarding a trip
on this application. Below we will describe the features in more detail.</p>

<p><b>Features:</b></p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Destination Recommendations</span></p>

<p>We will ask the user to input
some information about their budget constraints, interests and past travels and
our application will then suggest some destinations that matches their
preferences and help them explore new places.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Flight and Hotel Booking</span></p>

<p>In our application we will have
partnerships with airlines and accomodation providers, so that users can search
and compare prices of flights. All of that will be within the platform for
booking. This will make booking much easier for users and it will help them
saving time,money and energy by bringing together deals and details. With a
seamless booking system integrated directly into the app, users can search for
and reserve flights, hotels, restaurants, and rental cars. Users would be able
to use the app offline too.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Tool</span></p>

<p>A lot of travels have the problem
to find their gate in airports due to the fact, that airports are really huge
and it is mostly complicated to find the necessary gate for the flight. This
tool will help users to find their gate faster and easier. It works the same as
Google Map. So it will display the route and also have a speaking tool that
translate signs into any language.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Travel Updates and Alerts</span></p>

<p>Stay informed about flight
statuses and receive emergency alerts directly through the app. Globetracker
keeps travellers updated on any disruptions or changes to their itinerary, as
well as weather alerts, ensuring a smooth and stress-free travel experience.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Analytics and Insights</span></p>

<p>Users would be gaining valuable
insights into travel history and identify opportunities for cost-saving and
time optimization. By analysing past trips and expenditures, users can make
decisions to improve future travel experiences.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Expense Tracking and Budget
Management</span></p>

<p>Globetracker helps users to track
their expenses efficiently, monitor invoices, and generate expense reports in
real-time. This feature enables travellers to stay within budget and manage
finances effectively throughout their journey.</p>

<p><span class="" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 255);"># Customizable Trip Organization</span></p>

<p>Users can plan their trips
effortlessly by inputting their location and accessing customisable task lists.
From booking flights and accommodations to creating packing lists, Globetracker
streamlines the entire travel planning process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the project entails
the development of a web interface with user authentication functionality to
complement the mobile application. A server-side process will manage a global
database and cater to diverse clients' needs, leveraging existing server
infrastructure for integration. Globetracker aims to redefine the travel
management landscape by offering a solution that combines convenience,
efficiency, and personalisation.</p><br><p></p></body></html>
