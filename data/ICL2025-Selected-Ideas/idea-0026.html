  <p>The perfect book match: 
    The project involves an application designed to make the process of fnding 
    a new book an engaging and playful experience for the user. 
    The user is presented a book cover along with a short paragraph from the 
    book. Based on this they can decide to "like" the book by swiping right or 
    "dislike" it by swiping left. Initially, a selection of books is made available for 
    liking based on parameters chosen by the user at the start. This selection is 
    continuously updated and adjusted during the "like phase" according to the 
    user's decisions. 
    Once the last book has been rated, or if the user decides to end his rating
    phase, the algorithm evaluates the choices and presents the user their top 
    three matches.
    Furthermore there will be features; e.g. to track the books the user has read
    in an virtual bookshelf.</p><br><p></p></body></html>
