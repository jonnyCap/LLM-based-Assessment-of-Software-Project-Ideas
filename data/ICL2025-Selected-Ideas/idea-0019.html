  <p><span lang="DE-AT">An application, first and foremost for mobile devices, that lets users keep track of castles, zoos, museums, or other landmarks they
    visited. To make it more engaging, the app will feature gamification elements and social features. The gamification elements
    include, but are not limited to, a virtual character the user can create, a experience point system that is an indicator for how much
    the user knows about various landmarks, and challenges that can be completed at each location. The social features consist of the
    basics one would expect, such as rating locations, commenting, following other users, and so on. Additionally, there will be a
    separate mode for teachers to plan field trips for their classes and create custom challenges for their students to complete at the
    locations.
