  <p dir="ltr">Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time! Our world is precious but we
    don't care as much as we should! Therefore we asked ourselves a few questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Why is there so much waste of food?</li>
    <li>Why do people don't make sustainable choices?</li>
    <li>Why do people deny the climate change?</li>
    <li>Why is a greener future so circuitous?</li>
    <li>What does it take to incentivize eco-friendly behavior to everyone?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>While many people and businesses act already sustainable, there are unfortunately a lot
    of people who have little motivation for doing so. Most of the times it fails because of the
    idea to barely effect the CO2 emissions by doing odds-and-ends as a single person.</p>
  <p>"Count on me!" is an app designed to promote climate protection by rewarding the
    participants who track their sustainable actions to reduce their carbon footprint. We want
    not only try to make sustainability more attractive than ever, but make it user friendly as
    possible by creating an app for your smartphone. It converts your daily actions such as public
    transport, buying secondhand, or reducing waste into rewards like discounts, or vouchers for
    your locals. Every little step counts and together we can do something memorable! Let's
    count on us and appreciate sustainability together!</p>
  <p>How does it work? We collaborate with companies which offers possibilities to reduce the
    carbon footprint by buying specific products from them. This could be for example bread
    getting stale at the local bakery, food close to the expiration date, secondhand products or
    even train tickets. Our participants then receive points for these purchases and can redeem
    them next time. This leads to less waste, more public transport users and giving products
    a second chance!</p>
