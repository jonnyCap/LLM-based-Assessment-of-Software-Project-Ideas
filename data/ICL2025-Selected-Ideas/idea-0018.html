<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a smart assistent agent that can be accessed through an app or a web
  application. By providing the agent with data about your pre-existing health conditions, mood, general health,
  digestion, sleep, workout and food intake, the agent is able to identify patterns between these points, recognize
  potential food intolerances and provide basic training recommendations and meal/lifestyle adjustments based on
  the provided data to help the user improve their health. This is particularly useful for people suffering from chronic
  digestive issues, low energy levels and migraines, all of which can be mitigated with a proper health plan. The
  specificity of the data provided is left to the user, the more detailed it is, the better the agent will be able to
  perform, this will be achieved by utilizing a LLM to effectively interpret the users input. The app should be able to
  provide consistent tracking and recommendations for the user after a few days of accumulating enough data.</p>

<h1>Core Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Food &amp; Mood Tracking</b>: Users log their meals and rate their mood, energy levels, sleep and digestion (using
    smileys or short notes).</li>
  <li><b>Workout Tracking</b>: Simple logging of workout sessions (e.g., cardio, strength training) with a subjective
    performance rating.</li>
  <li><b>Pattern Recognition &amp; Insights</b>: AI analyzes correlations between food, mood, sleep and training, providing
    personalized recommendations.</li>
  <li><b>Food Intolerance Predictions</b>: The app detects potential intolerances based on logged symptoms and
    suggests adjustments to test the user's reaction.</li>
  <li><b>Personalized Meal Suggestions</b>: Based on collected data, the app suggests suitable meals.</li>
  <li><b>Challenges &amp; Gamification</b>: Users can participate in small challenges (e.g., “3 days sugar-free,” similar to
    Strava) and track their progress to earn different badges/achievements.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Potential Extensions</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Connection to various fitness and health apps</b>: Connect to meal-tracking apps, fitness apps and other
    health apps to automatically log workouts, food consumption, sleep and other data. (e.g. Apples "Health",
    "Yazio" and "Migraine Buddy").    
    </li>
  <li><b>Web-Browser User Interface</b>: For a better user experience an additional web application could be provided.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Funding</h1>
The app will feature a limited free version with advertisements and a paid subscription model.
