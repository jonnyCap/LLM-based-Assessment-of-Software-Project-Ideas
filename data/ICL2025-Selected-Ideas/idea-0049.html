<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Rento is a user-friendly app designed to facilitate the renting and selling of products, with a particular focus on electronics, tools, and services. The platform
  caters to individuals who need temporary access to items or want to monetize
  underutilized possessions. In addition to renting products, Rento also allows
  users to rent services from skilled individuals—whether it's handyman help,
  tutoring, pet sitting, or other personal services.</p>
<p>It serves as an ideal solution for students moving to a new city who may need
  tools, electronics, or specific services for short-term use, as well as homeowners
  or renters with occasional items—like lawnmowers or power tools—who want to
  earn extra income by offering them for rent. The platform also makes it easy to
  find and rent services from people in your community for any number of tasks,
  enhancing convenience for everyone.

<h1>Core Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Peer-to-Peer Marketplace</b>: Users can list items for rent or sale, creating a community-driven marketplace for goods that are not used daily
    but are expensive to buy outright.</li>
  <li><b>Focus on High-Demand Items</b>: The platform emphasizes items such
    as electronics (laptops, cameras, phones) and tools (drills, lawnmowers,
    etc.), catering to people who need temporary access to these products
    without the high upfront cost.</li>
  <li><b>Seamless Renting and Selling Experience</b>: The app enables users
    to easily browse, rent, or purchase items from others within their local
    community. In addition to standard rentals, users can negotiate the length
    and cost of the rental directly through the app.</li>
  <li><b>Rent Services from Humans</b>: Rento also allows users to rent services
    from skilled individuals in their community. Whether it's hiring a handyman, a tutor, a pet sitter, or other personal services, users can easily
    find and book these services within the app, enhancing convenience and
    providing a flexible way to meet various needs.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Token-Based System</h1>
<p>To further enhance the platform's functionality and encourage user engagement,
  Rento will introduce a token-based reward system. Tokens are earned when
  users actively participate in the process, such as delivering or picking up rented
  items. The more valuable or bulky the item being transferred, the more tokens
  are awarded.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Earning Tokens</b>: Users can accumulate tokens through activities like
    delivering or picking up rented products, fostering a more robust and
    engaged community. This system helps reduce the logistical burden often
    associated with peer-to-peer rentals, providing motivation for users to our
    services such as delivery.
    </li>
  <li><b>Redeeming Tokens</b>: Tokens can be redeemed for a variety of rewards,
    including small discounts on future rentals or purchases, or even the opportunity to ”rent” or ”buy” other products on the platform. This creates
    a win-win for both renters and owners, as it lowers the cost of participation
    and encourages more active involvement in the community.</li>
</ul>
