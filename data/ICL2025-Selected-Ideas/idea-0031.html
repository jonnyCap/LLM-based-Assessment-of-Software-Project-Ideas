    We aim to create a program that helps people achieve their goals by
    integrating AI to provide support and develop personalized plans for goal
    completion.
    In the app, users can create a project as their goal, where they can
    manage various elements such as to-do lists (daily, weekly, etc.),
    exercises, text sections, and step-by-step progress tracking. All of these
    components can be generated using an AI interface based on a popular
    LLM.
    AI Functions in the App:
    ● Answering user questions within the context of their goal.
    ● Assisting in adding steps and tasks to to-do lists.
