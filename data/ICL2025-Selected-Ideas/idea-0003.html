<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"></head><body><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">A neighbourhood market app for people who don't want to throw everything away. Our platform is the answer to the needs of many people today. On our app, customers find a safe haven for selling and exchanging their unwanted items so that they can find a new happy owner again. Our site consists of a feed that categorizes listings by proximity. The arrangements of the sale or exchange are handled via chat messages so that our customers can discuss the detailed needs of the proper handling. The purpose of the app is to support people to trade more locally and to counteract the throwaway trend of our consumer society and offer alternatives to large marketplaces. The focus is solely on intuitive, simple usability and efficient handling so that every customer can also be a satisfied customer and participant in the local market.<br></p></body></html>
