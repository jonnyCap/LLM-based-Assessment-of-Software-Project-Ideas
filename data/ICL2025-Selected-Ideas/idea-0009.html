  <p><span lang="DE-AT">In our project we want to implement an app that can track the resting heart
    rate to draw conclusions about the user's current physical fitness. For the most
    precise measurement the user needs to lay their mobile phone on their chest
    right after waking up. Since the resting heart rate of a person usually remains
    constant, sudden changes can indicate that the body is experiencing stress,
    which often suggests that it has been weakened by excessive strain or even
    the onset of illness. With this method the user can draw conclusions about
    their current fitness state and can adapt their training schedule for the day
    accordingly.
    The heart rate is tracked with the microphone, which is more precise than
    measurements taken with the camera as it is practiced in already available apps.
    There are no additional devices necessary. The data is collected and processed
    locally and therefore safer considering security regards.
