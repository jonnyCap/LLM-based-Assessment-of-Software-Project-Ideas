<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"></head><body><p dir="ltr">Our idea is to create an app for phones where you can sell and buy second-hand clothing 
  items. You can sell the clothing by uploading it with a description and the price you want to 
  sell it for. To browse through items you want to buy, you can adjust a set of filters on the 
  screen to your liking and then start swiping through the results in the style of a dating app.
  The clothes which are shown to you are determined by an AI-supported algorithm which 
  adjusts to your preferences. If you like the item, you swipe right, if you dislike it, you swipe 
  left. After swiping right, the item is saved to your list of favorites. When scrolling through your 
  list of favorite items, you can decide whether you want to contact the seller or not.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p></body></html>
