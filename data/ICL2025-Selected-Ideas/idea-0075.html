  <p><span lang="DE-AT">We would like to plan a patient-management system designed for
    deployment in doctor's offices and hospitals across Austria. Var￾ious professionals work together in these facilities, ranging from
    doctor's assistants handling appointments and pre-examinations,
    to technicians that perform scans, nurses and doctors. Our system
    will unite them all, with a focus on a modern and modular inter￾face that can be easily adapted to suit the diverse needs of this
    work environment. The sensitive patient data also puts a major
    emphasis on security, alongside a robust and reliable database.
