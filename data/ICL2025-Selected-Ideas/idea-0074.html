  <p><span lang="DE-AT">Project Description: GhostChess
    We would like to present our project idea for the UE Project Management. The project is based 
on an already existing real start-up idea and a sub-area, which focuses on software, is to be 
developed over the course of the semester using various taught project management methods.
Problem definition
Active and professional chess players are particularly familiar with this problem: staring at the 
screen for hours on end in order to improve at chess.
Solution: GhostChess
GhostChess brings the advantages of online chess to a real, high-quality wooden chess board. 
With GhostChess you can play at any time and against anyone in the world on a tangible board 
that automatically recognizes your moves and transmits them to an online platform such as 
Lichess or Chess.com. Your opponents' moves are executed directly on the board - as if they 
were being moved by a ghost. But GhostChess goes even further: it analyzes games, records 
games with friends or tracks live matches from championships directly on the board. 
GhostChess combines the best of the digital world with the classic chess experience: on a high-quality wooden board.
Project scope in the UE: Development of an app / interface
Within the scope of this UE, software is to be developed on the basis of the GhostChess 
technology that should serve as an interface between the user and the chessboard, connects 
the board with the online world and makes this interaction accessible via a user-friendly UI.
Some features that the project should include
▪ Connection to the GhostChess board (via Bluetooth or WiFi)
▪ Real-time import of the piece position on the physical board into the app
▪ Automatic recording of chess games through continuous synchronization with the board
▪ API integration with Lichess & Chess.com
▪ Playing online chess games in real-time on the GhostChess board
▪ Live streaming of championships or friendly games directly to the board
▪ Chess puzzles and training modes that can be solved directly on the board
▪ etc

Business model
The monetization concept for the app is still being worked out, but a subscription model is 
planned.
