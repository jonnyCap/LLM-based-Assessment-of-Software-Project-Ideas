<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8"></head><body>We want to develop a platform that connects people with similar interests to participate 
  in events, activities and courses together or organize spontaneuos meetups.
  Users can browse existing events, sign up, purchase tickets, or organize their own 
  gatheringsâ€”ranging from private parties and sports meetups to community events.
  An integrated event management system allows individuals and organizations to create 
  events, set participation requirements, and manage attendees. A built-in chat feature 
  facilitates coordination among participants, while event ratings ensure transparency 
  and reliability. 
  Businesses such as fitness studios, dance schools, and entertainment venues can 
  promote their offerings to a targeted audience.
  By combining social networking with event discovery and management, the platform 
  provides a centralized solution for those looking to engage in shared experiences or 
  organize their own activities.<br /><p></p></body></html>
