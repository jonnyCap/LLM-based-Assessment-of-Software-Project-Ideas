With our project, a browser or application, depending on what makes more sense for the scope (feedback much appreciated!), we would like to provide a step in the right direction - giving users the option to share a percentage of their CPU processing with a central computation unit sending out individual tasks, which barely increases their environmental footprint as power consumption remains basically unchanged while making a big dent in overall power required to achieve the same result worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Apart from reducing the overall footprint, users will be provided with a transparent dashboard that displays how their computing power has been utilized. This ensures more visibilty of how the profits generated from their shared processing power directly support environmental projects. Whether funding, reforestation efforts, or other sustainability initiatives, users can track their impact in real time, reinforcing trust and engagement in a greener future.</span></p></body></html>
