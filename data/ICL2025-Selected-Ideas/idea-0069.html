  <p>The project idea is about a work time tracking software that allows users to log their
    working hours easily. Users can sign in and record their working hours, such as in the
    morning and evening. The app also includes a feature to request vacation days and a
    calendar to display work schedules, approved leaves and other relevant events. The goal
    is to provide companies with a simple and efficient solution for managing employeesâ€™ work
    hours.</p>
