However, this means that pollen count is starting as well, making it difficult for allergic people to enjoy this time of renaissance.Â <br />Our idea is to offer an app for allergic people, in order to overcome this season without annoying disturbances such as runny noses or dizziness. Thus, our app would include features such as tracking the user's mood and the intensity of symptoms over time, allerting the user when certain allergens are in season or reminding them to take their medicine. Furthermore, it could analyse patterns in the allergic person's symptoms to help the user identify its triggers in case an allergy test did not fulfill its requirements or hasn't been made.</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"></p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"></p></body></html>
