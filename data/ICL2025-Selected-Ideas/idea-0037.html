idea is about a learning-platform, kind of similar to the TeachCenter of the
university, but with the advantage of having all information and actions for a
course at one place, for having a better overview and more convenience.<br />
<br />
Also we would implement an improved version of the Safe-Exam-Browser, that is
operating-system-independent, and offers a better usability. </span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">We also
provide extensive statistical analyses from assignments and exams conducted in
our learning-platform (analysis probably with LLMS).</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Finally,
the system will include a personalized study program feature that tracks
individual progress and delivers targeted feedback, helping each student
optimize their learning journey.</span></p></body></html>
