  <h1>Better Version of TeachCenter</h1>
  <p>What Makes It Different?
    Our Website/App will include all the feedback from students to create a TU-Graz-Online Extension, 
    which is more user-friendly, is better organised and integrates an all-in solution for all courses
    combined.</p>
  <p>Core Concept: 
    There are two big key features, which makes this idea so great. The first one is the integration of a 
    Discord-like communication system, ensuring seamless interaction between students and professors, 
    which will replace all the Discord-Servers (5+ per Semester). The second one is the introduction to a 
    mobile app, which meets the needs of students.
    </p>
  <p>Mobile App: 
    Since students prefer mobile solutions, our app ensures access to everything they need—anytime, 
    anywhere. Cool features will be for example:
    • Customizable notifications to keep students updated.
    • A dashboard displaying all important deadlines, including assignments, homework, and 
    exams.</p>
  <p>Goal:
    The goal after release is to convince every professor to use the new Extension and set the 
    corresponding deadlines for homeworks, assignments and tests. This would allow us to create
    powerful dashboards that simplifies student planning, which currently everybody has to do by hand.</p>
  <p>The Solution:
    • Saves students time by automating deadline tracking.
    • Eliminates the need for external apps like Discord.
    • Combines everything in one Extension.</p>
  <p>Vision:
    We plan to launch the app at TU Graz first. Once successful, we will scale it to other universities, 
    starting in Austria and eventually expanding across Europe and beyond.</p>
