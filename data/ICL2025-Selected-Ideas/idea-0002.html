  <p dir="ltr">Our project would make ordering food easier for the users.
    This web- and mobile application would offer people food /
    restaurant recommendations based on their location and
    preferences in the style that resembles the Instagram "for you"
    page.</p>
  <p>There would be pictures and videos of meals, food making
    videos, and after the user clicked on a picture of a meal, the
    app would show the name of the meal, the ingredients and the
    price and the distance of the restaurant. There would be the
    option to order the food, and the user could choose from
    different food delivery services (Foodora, Foodpanda, etc.).</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p></body></html>
