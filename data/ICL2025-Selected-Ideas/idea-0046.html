  <p dir="ltr">Projekt Idea: Uni Campus Navigation System (UCNS)

    This project focuses on developing a University Campus Navigation System, a mobile application designed to assist university students, faculty members, and visitors in navigating large university campuses efficiently. The app integrates advanced navigation, scheduling, and accessibility features to ensure smooth and easy movement across the campus.
    
    App Features: 
    
    Campus Navigation: 
    
    ● Users can find routes to specific buildings, lecture halls, offices, and facilities.
    ● Real-time guidance with turn-by-turn directions for both outdoor and indoor locations.
    
    Task & Schedule Management: 
    
    ● Users can access their daily class schedules and academic events.
    ● Automated reminders and notifications for scheduled lectures, exams, and meetings.
    ● Personalized dashboard to track ongoing coursework and deadlines.
    
    Interactive Map & Points of Interest: 
    
    ● Displays key campus locations such as libraries, dormitories, cafeterias, and study halls.
    ● Highlights emergency exits, accessible routes, and administrative offices.
    ● Live updates on facility availability and operation hours.
    
    Security & Access Control: 
    
    ● Secure access control for restricted areas like labs and faculty rooms with QR code authentication.
    ● Verification of access permissions for authorized zones within the campus.
    ● Emergency contact integration for quick response in urgent situations.
    
    Accessibility & Assistance: 
    
    ● Wheelchair-friendly route suggestions and elevator locations.
    ● Voice-assistance navigation for visually impaired users.
    ● Language translation options for international students and faculty.
    
    Automated Time Planning: 
    
    ● Users can input estimated time for tasks and movements across the campus.
    ● The app automatically suggests the best time slots and routes to optimize efficiency.
    ● Avoids delays by factoring in real-time movement patterns and congestion data.
    
    App Goal: 
    
    The University Campus Navigation System aims to provide an intuitive and well-structured interface that enhances efficiency, security, and organization within university campuses. By combining real-time navigation, schedule tracking, security protocols, and accessibility features, the app ensures that students and faculty can focus on their academic and administrative responsibilities without logistical challenges.</p>
