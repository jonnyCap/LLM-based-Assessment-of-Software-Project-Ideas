  <p>Project Idea: Travel Guru (Name WIP)

    Overview:
    Travel Guru is an app designed to simplify travel planning by offering users the cheapest options for flights, local transport, activities, and more.
    The user can select desired regions and the app tries to find the cheapest all-in-one combos to a destination within this region, without needing to check multiple websites. It also should notify the user if there exists an extremely cheap flight, hotel, etc.
    The app operates on a subscription-based model and should contain referral links to maximize profit (if possible).
    Future updates: integrated calendar (personal data), reviews, and personalized tips.</p>

<p>USPs:

  • All-in-One App:
  The app covers every aspect of travel planning.
  
  • Dynamic Feed:
  A scrollable feed like a social media app to suggest trending destinations, hot deals, etc.
  
  • Personalized Travel Experience:
  The app learns user preferences over time (e.g., beach holidays, city breaks, or adventure trips) and tailors recommendations to match their unique travel style.
  
  • Cost Efficiency:
  Travel Guru tries to find the most affordable travel options without compromising quality.</p><br><p></p></body></html>
