to make a website/app that aims to improve parking. It does so by allowing you
to buy parking tickets in the app that automatically store the location of your
car. If you buy a parking ticket, the spot your car is in will automatically be
marked unavailable for another person to use, making it easier to see and
navigate to available parking spots in the area. The app may also include a
navigation system that shows you the way to available parking spots.</span></p><br><p></p></body></html>
