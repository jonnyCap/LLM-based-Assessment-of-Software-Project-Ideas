  <p dir="ltr">Our idea is to create a software that will help to monitor patients with medical conditions. It
    will be firstly linked to a specific clinic and in future might be sold into others.</p>
  <p>The app will allow users to insert data about their health from medical devices that are
    accessible to use from home. For example heartbeat rate, sugar level in blood, blood
    pressure, temperature etc and also laboratory tests . The whole information in chronological
    order and also the whole information about patient will be accessible for doctors so they can
    see how the condition is progressing over last time. It will help them to see if the method of
    curing the disease is effective and also they will be notified if something is going wrong by
    the patient.</p><p>Also in the app for patient will be accessible the plan of consuming medicine (dosage, time,
      usage instruction), available doctors at specific clinic and feedbacks about them, possibility
      to book an appointment etc.</p><p dir="ltr"><br></p></body></html>
