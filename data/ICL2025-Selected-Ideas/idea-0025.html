  QR code on the menu:
  - Access to a digital version of the menu.
  - Pictures and detailed information of each dish.
  - Recommendations on what to eat, based on previous restaurant visits and preferences.
  - Automatic translations of the menu.
  - Filtering the menu by allergens, dietary restrictions, and personal dislikes (e.g., "no mushrooms").
