We all know the problem of dying houseplants and empty pots in our flats. To solve this, our app simplifies the lives of all of us with several features such as Plant Identification &amp; Database, Smart Watering Reminders and a Plant Health Scanner. We are also thinking about potential IoT expansions, eg. the sale of soil moisture sensors and watering devices that synchronize with the app. </span><br><p></p></body></html>
