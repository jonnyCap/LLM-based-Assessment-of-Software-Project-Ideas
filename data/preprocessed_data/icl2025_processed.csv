7,"Introduction: In today's world, where energy consumption and sustainability are major concerns, managing household energy consumption efficiently is more crucial than ever. According to a study conducted by the Austrian Environment Agency, Austrian households generate between 18 and 54 tons of CO₂ per year, depending on their lifestyle and living situation. However, by implementing certain measures such as improved energy management, these emissions can be reduced by 41% to 72%, equating to a savings of 7 to 14 tons of CO₂ per household annually. The growing energy demand, combined with environmental issues such as climate change, calls for innovative, creative solutions to reduce energy waste and optimize consumption. To address these problems, we have decided to develop a system that will help our clients optimize and reduce the amount of energy used in their homes and offices. Our system will utilize smart outlets that connect to an application via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, allowing real-time energy consumption monitoring and control. These smart outlets will be integrated with AI algorithms to analyze usage patterns and provide personalized recommendations for saving energy. Users will be able to remotely control connected devices, such as home appliances, office equipment, and classroom electronics, ensuring optimized and efficient energy use. Additionally, businesses and households will benefit from significant cost savings, as they will constantly have insight into their energy usage, enabling them to identify excessive consumption and optimize their energy utilization accordingly. Through automation and predictive analytics, our solution aims to reduce unnecessary and excessive energy use, promote sustainability, and enhance cost efficiency. Objectives: Primary Objectives: • Implement an AI algorithm that can predict energy consumption and recommend energy-saving actions with at least 80% accuracy based on historical usage data. • Develop an intelligent energy management system that integrates with smart home and industrial IoT devices to optimize energy consumption through automation, real-time monitoring, and AI-driven recommendations. Technical Objectives: • Develop a system for customizable notifications that allows users to set at least three different types of alerts (e.g., high usage, device offline, energy-saving tip). Financial Objectives: • Reduce energy costs by optimizing energy consumption, resulting in significant savings for households or businesses. • Increase the use of sustainable energy sources to reduce dependence on non-renewable energy and lower long-term energy costs. Business and Stakeholder Objectives: • Partner with enterprises to promote energy efficiency, adhere to energy regulations, and raise user awareness for better energy optimization. System Architecture The system will be implemented using smart outlets that connect to household or office devices such as heaters, air conditioners, and water boilers. Each device will be automatically numbered in the app (e.g., “Device 1”), but users can rename devices based on the environment - like “Smith's Oven” in a household or “Company's AC” in an office. In addition to basic monitoring, the system will allow users to control appliances remotely via the app, such as turning on the heating or water boiler before arriving home. Users will also receive real-time notifications about device status and energy-saving recommendations (e.g., “Device 2 has been on for 4 hours. Consider turning it off to save energy.”). A key feature will be an AI-powered algorithm that adapts to user behavior over time. The AI will track patterns in device usage and optimize energy consumption based on household or office routines. Over time, it will offer personalized energy-saving recommendations. Attachable displays on devices like fridges or water boilers will show real-time status updates, showing whether the device is “On” or “Off” and the last activation time. Color-coded indicators (green for “On,” red for “Off”) will improve visibility, while notifications may provide energy-saving tips. Energy Consumption Analytics will allow users to track energy usage over time through the app, with reports on daily, weekly, or monthly trends. This will help users identify high-energy-consuming devices and take action to reduce usage. The app will display this data through simple charts and graphs for easy understanding. Additionally, if a user significantly reduces consumption over a month, a “virtual energy bank” will visualize their savings, which can be used in offline mode or when extra power is needed, promoting sustainability. To make the system more engaging, the app could present creative messages to users about their energy use, such as: “You've saved enough energy to power 50 LED bulbs for a day!” or “You've wasted enough energy to charge 10 phones from 0 to 100%!” These messages will motivate users to continue optimizing their energy consumption. While this feature would require a premium subscription for access, the system will support voice control, enabling users to manage devices through simple voice commands via platforms like Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Additionally, users will be able to schedule device usage, setting automatic on/off times. Each user will have a personalized account to manage their own devices, with customizable permissions, ensuring security for all users. Lastly, two-factor authentication (2FA) will be implemented to secure user accounts and ensure that only authorized individuals can access and control the system. Conclusion In today's world, where each action affects our environment, the need for sustainability is clearer than ever. Our growing energy consumption and environmental issues require a change in how we use resources. This project isn't just about lowering costs or reducing emissions – it's about raising awareness, promoting change, and using technology to optimize energy use. By utilizing smart outlets, real-time monitoring, and AI-driven recommendations, our system provides an effective way to reduce waste, promote sustainability, and ensure significant cost savings. With features like predictive analytics, customizable alerts, and voice control, it empowers users to take control of their energy consumption. Ultimately, this project could help reduce reliance on non-renewable energy, promote innovation, and contribute to a more sustainable future."
8,"In our project we want to implement an app that can track the resting heart rate to draw conclusions about the user's current physical fitness. For the most precise measurement the user needs to lay their mobile phone on their chest right after waking up. Since the resting heart rate of a person usually remains constant, sudden changes can indicate that the body is experiencing stress, which often suggests that it has been weakened by excessive strain or even the onset of illness. With this method the user can draw conclusions about their current fitness state and can adapt their training schedule for the day accordingly. The heart rate is tracked with the microphone, which is more precise than measurements taken with the camera as it is practiced in already available apps. There are no additional devices necessary. The data is collected and processed locally and therefore safer considering security regards."
9,"Description of the project idea Our project idea deals with software that serves the purpose of simplifying appointment bookings by doctors for patients and at the same time relieving the medical personnel in Austria. Patients can register, verify their person and set up their profile (specify their doctors with the necessary confirmation by the doctor, indicate radius of place of residence). Doctors can also create a profile for their practice and relevant data such as B. Date the options, maximum number of new patients etc. The basic idea is that a patient can search for a kind of doctor on his radius with the desired period of the appointment (or other filter criteria such as vacation). In the search results, stored doctors should be displayed at the top of this type of doctor (if available), followed by other suitable options. This service is said to be a supplement to the current system of appointments/sick leave/transfers at doctors in order to reduce the organizational load of the health system in certain areas. Furthermore, doctors no longer have to wait for their own website and/or booking system and the telephone lines are becoming free for real emergencies. If successful, there is also the option to expand the service and offer as an app."

13,"Application for more efficient bar operations In our project, we are planning to develop an innovative mobile application, which is intended to support bars in optimizing your company and increasing customer satisfaction. The app should enable bar owners to create a profile for their location in order to communicate special events, news and changes. In addition, the integration of drinks cards is planned, which means that customers can give up and pay for orders directly via the app. This reduces the need for manual order acceptance and billing, which leads to a significant saving for the bars and more efficient operation. Furthermore, the app enables users to search for local within a certain area and to view their own order history. Analytical data is provided for the operators that offer detailed insights into order quantities and statistics and thus facilitate planning. Our goal is to develop an application that brings advantages for both companies and the users. BARS can increase their productivity by using the system and reduce costs, while users receive simple access to trendy restaurants and benefit from a simple and modern ordering process."
14,"We want to create an application that offers a loyalty program for small restaurants. The system would use a shared card that connects multiple restaurants. Each restaurant would have a unique identifier that users can add to their profile. Restaurants could upload their own discounts, and a points system could also be implemented. This solution would help replace paper-based stamp cards or individual loyalty cards, making the system more convenient for both restaurants and customers."
15,"It is about the following idea: We want to offer a platform that enables users to expand their own knowledge. We want to convey this knowledge through quizzes. Our platform should offer the possibility that users can complete quizzes from different categories. The topics that are available change in a certain period of time to create larger variance. The goal behind this system is to encourage people to find out more about new subject areas. Furthermore, the learning experience that we offer should have a varied and enriching effect, especially for younger users. The content provided on the platform is mainly created by the user base itself. In the course of this, the aim is to provide an editor or a toolkit, which enables the design process of this quizzes simple and linear. A qualification system is used to ensure the correctness of the answers or content. Depending on the correctness of the sources that match the topics, the quizzes are offered publicly, but there should also be the possibility for private purposes to create questions that do not have to be proven. The original transfer of knowledge should take place with the help of artificial intelligence. A short version of the sources provided is created based on the questions. In addition, there should be the possibility of offering verified quizzes if the creator should have a renowned training in this field. Cooperation with higher educational institutions would offer themselves. These quizzes would be categorically highlighted by others, for example with a ""checkmark"" system. In the future, other aspects could also be added. For example, a karma system that rewards users check the quizzes for their correctness and possibly correct. A community feature with rankings, user profiles or similar social aspects would also be worth considering."
16,"Community-based sustainable lending and rental platform We develop a lending and rental platform that enables users to borrow objects for temporary needs from others near them. This solution is aimed particularly at students, freshly moved people and people in transition phases to enable them to use necessary objects without having to buy them again. By promoting the sharing, we contribute to reducing new goods consumption and thus supporting sustainability. Users can pay via a loan system that also includes a deposit for possible damage. We keep a small share in every transaction, which means that we generate our profit. A valuation system ensures trust and security within the community. Our goal is to offer a cost -effective and ecologically sustainable alternative to buying new purchase that covers the temporary need for objects without long -term investments."
17,"Project Description The goal of this project is to develop a smart assistent agent that can be accessed through an app or a web application. By providing the agent with data about your pre-existing health conditions, mood, general health, digestion, sleep, workout and food intake, the agent is able to identify patterns between these points, recognize potential food intolerances and provide basic training recommendations and meal/lifestyle adjustments based on the provided data to help the user improve their health. This is particularly useful for people suffering from chronic digestive issues, low energy levels and migraines, all of which can be mitigated with a proper health plan. The specificity of the data provided is left to the user, the more detailed it is, the better the agent will be able to perform, this will be achieved by utilizing a LLM to effectively interpret the users input. The app should be able to provide consistent tracking and recommendations for the user after a few days of accumulating enough data. Core Features Food & Mood Tracking : Users log their meals and rate their mood, energy levels, sleep and digestion (using smileys or short notes). Workout Tracking : Simple logging of workout sessions (e.g., cardio, strength training) with a subjective performance rating. Pattern Recognition & Insights : AI analyzes correlations between food, mood, sleep and training, providing personalized recommendations. Food Intolerance Predictions : The app detects potential intolerances based on logged symptoms and suggests adjustments to test the user's reaction. Personalized Meal Suggestions : Based on collected data, the app suggests suitable meals. Challenges & Gamification : Users can participate in small challenges (e.g., “3 days sugar-free,” similar to Strava) and track their progress to earn different badges/achievements. Potential Extensions Connection to various fitness and health apps : Connect to meal-tracking apps, fitness apps and other health apps to automatically log workouts, food consumption, sleep and other data. (e.g. Apples ""Health"", ""Yazio"" and ""Migraine Buddy""). Web-Browser User Interface : For a better user experience an additional web application could be provided. Funding The app will feature a limited free version with advertisements and a paid subscription model."
18,"An application, first and foremost for mobile devices, that lets users keep track of castles, zoos, museums, or other landmarks they visited. To make it more engaging, the app will feature gamification elements and social features. The gamification elements include, but are not limited to, a virtual character the user can create, a experience point system that is an indicator for how much the user knows about various landmarks, and challenges that can be completed at each location. The social features consist of the basics one would expect, such as rating locations, commenting, following other users, and so on. Additionally, there will be a separate mode for teachers to plan field trips for their classes and create custom challenges for their students to complete at the locations."
19,"Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time! Our world is precious but we don't care as much as we should! Therefore we asked ourselves a few questions: Why is there so much waste of food? Why do people don't make sustainable choices? Why do people deny the climate change? Why is a greener future so circuitous? What does it take to incentivize eco-friendly behavior to everyone? While many people and businesses act already sustainable, there are unfortunately a lot of people who have little motivation for doing so. Most of the times it fails because of the idea to barely effect the CO2 emissions by doing odds-and-ends as a single person. ""Count on me!"" is an app designed to promote climate protection by rewarding the participants who track their sustainable actions to reduce their carbon footprint. We want not only try to make sustainability more attractive than ever, but make it user friendly as possible by creating an app for your smartphone. It converts your daily actions such as public transport, buying secondhand, or reducing waste into rewards like discounts, or vouchers for your locals. Every little step counts and together we can do something memorable! Let's count on us and appreciate sustainability together! How does it work? We collaborate with companies which offers possibilities to reduce the carbon footprint by buying specific products from them. This could be for example bread getting stale at the local bakery, food close to the expiration date, secondhand products or even train tickets. Our participants then receive points for these purchases and can redeem them next time. This leads to less waste, more public transport users and giving products a second chance!"

The user is presented a book cover along with a short paragraph from the book. Based on this they can decide to ""like"" the book by swiping right or ""dislike"" it by swiping left. Initially, a selection of books is made available for liking based on parameters chosen by the user at the start. This selection is continuously updated and adjusted during the ""like phase"" according to the user's decisions. Once the last book has been rated, or if the user decides to end his rating phase, the algorithm evaluates the choices and presents the user their top three matches. Furthermore there will be features; e.g. to track the books the user has read in an virtual bookshelf."
26,"Project idea group TM-3 It is to be created that software can be created that can control and manage smart home devices of all kinds energy-efficiently. The user entered all of its devices in our software. These devices can be, for example: · lamps etc. · air conditioning/heating · automatic window · humid moisture · Ev. Charging station for electric car In addition, the customer can enter different sensors in the software. These sensors could include: · temperature sensors · Air humidity sensors · Live weather data · place of residence (and floor) of the owner · If available, current production of your own photovoltaic system The devices are then automatically controlled. The software will try to bring all data together and therefore automatically always producing a pleasant living climate in the apartment or house of the user and using as little energy as possible. For example, it will use the live weather data in order to activate the heating only if the outside temperature is not sufficient to bring the apartment to a pleasant temperature during the day. Or you will use the data of a possible PV system so as not to activate too many devices at the same time. In addition, the user could also define his own rules according to which the smart home devices are to be controlled. For example, a window can be opened from a desired temperature or the heating/air conditioning system can be switched on. Or the dehumidifier can be activated as soon as a certain humidity has been reached. If the customer has a photovoltaic system, he could also determine rules how the solar power is to be used. For example, he could set priorities that the apartment is heated first and then loaded the electric car. However, these own rules should not be necessary for the function of the software, but only optional. The software should also achieve the best possible energy efficiency without its own rules."
27,"Our goal is to develop an innovative platform that solves the problem when friends come together to watch a film but have difficulty agreeing to a film. Inspired by the known concept of Tinder, our platform enables users to match films to matches that meet their preferences. However, the platform should be more than just a tool for decision -making for film evenings. We want to create a living community of film fans who can exchange ideas about their common interests. Users can evaluate films, write reviews and share lists with friends to exchange recommendations. The integration of film databases such as IMDB or TMDB provides comprehensive information on films, including reviews and descriptions of action. An important aspect of our project is the opportunity to become an official partner of a streaming platform. This would not only be a source of financing for our platform, but also offer a way to limit the selection of available films and offer users a seamless way to watch selected films directly on the streaming platform. With this combination of matching functions, community interaction and seamless integration with streaming platforms, we strive to create a dynamic and entertaining platform that improves the film experience for millions of people worldwide."

31,"Better Version of TeachCenter What Makes It Different? Our Website/App will include all the feedback from students to create a TU-Graz-Online Extension, which is more user-friendly, is better organised and integrates an all-in solution for all courses combined. Core Concept: There are two big key features, which makes this idea so great. The first one is the integration of a Discord-like communication system, ensuring seamless interaction between students and professors, which will replace all the Discord-Servers (5+ per Semester). The second one is the introduction to a mobile app, which meets the needs of students. Mobile App: Since students prefer mobile solutions, our app ensures access to everything they need—anytime, anywhere. Cool features will be for example: • Customizable notifications to keep students updated. • A dashboard displaying all important deadlines, including assignments, homework, and exams. Goal: The goal after release is to convince every professor to use the new Extension and set the corresponding deadlines for homeworks, assignments and tests. This would allow us to create powerful dashboards that simplifies student planning, which currently everybody has to do by hand. The Solution: • Saves students time by automating deadline tracking. • Eliminates the need for external apps like Discord. • Combines everything in one Extension. Vision: We plan to launch the app at TU Graz first. Once successful, we will scale it to other universities, starting in Austria and eventually expanding across Europe and beyond."

39,"Projektmanagement Quack.DG (Quack Digital Growth) Quack.DG is designed as a web and mobile platform with the goal to connect small businesses and nearby customers. Inspired by how ducks communicate via their unique ""quacks,"" Quack.DG offers a platform to support small businesses, like local service providers, to ""make noise"" and get in touch with customers. While especially small, regional businesses lack the time or expertise to build up an online presence on their own, our application proactively reaches out to them and helps them grow in the digital world. Key Features - Proactive business onboarding via direct outreach to businesses. - Easy profile management with AI-assisted content refinement and automated, high-level customer support. - Regular updates on profile customer interactions via notifications using preferred channels (such as email or push messages). - Advanced local search functionality using semantic search, filters, and speech-to-text. - Simple and effective communication via direct in-app messages or sharing of conventional communication channels. - Accessibility management with free available content and a structured user account system for preference, update, and business management. - Monetization strategies like a subscription model, highlighted advertising, and exclusive premium tools. - High potential for future expansions, such as social media support, simple business management tools, local product listings, shared business insights, and an optional online payment service. With a focus on keeping things local and easy to use, the application plays a key role in strengthening communication and building connections between suppliers and customers. This ensures that small businesses benefit from their new online visibility as much as possible, making digital integration more effortless than ever before. Connecting Small Businesses with Local Customers Quack.DG is a web and mobile application designed to connect small businesses - such as tailors, carpenters, shoemakers, and bicycle repair shops - with local customers. The platform helps these businesses gain visibility online while providing customers with a seamless way to discover and connect with service providers in their area. Proactive Business Engagement and Onboarding A major focus of Quack.DG is actively reaching out to small businesses. The platform does not simply wait for businesses to sign up but takes an active role in contacting and introducing them to the service. This includes direct outreach via emails and phone calls, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with digital platforms understand how Quack.DG can help them attract customers. Once a business expresses interest, they create an account to manage their information, such as updating business hours, descriptions, and images. The platform assists with writing and structuring content, ensuring that business descriptions are effective and engaging without requiring business owners to be technical experts. A simple text support feature allows them to write in their own words and have it automatically refined for clarity and professionalism. This keeps the focus on their craft and not digital marketing. Keeping Businesses Engaged with Customer Interactions To ensure businesses remain engaged and do not just upload their information once and forget about it, Quack.DG provides continuous updates on customer interactions. Business owners receive notifications whenever potential customers engage with their profiles - whether it is a direct inquiry, a request for more information, or general activity such as views and clicks. For those who may not frequently check their accounts, updates are sent via email or SMS, ensuring that even those without smartphones stay informed. For those using the mobile app, push notifications help keep them engaged without requiring them to actively log in. This way, businesses remain aware of their online presence and customer interest without additional effort. All interactions are simple and intuitive; business owners do not need to manage complex dashboards or marketing tools. Instead, they receive clear, actionable updates about customer interest without unnecessary complications. Optimized Search for End Users Quack.DG ensures that businesses are easily discoverable, both within the platform and externally. This means businesses can also be indexed by search engines like Google and found directly through external searches (e.g., Grazer bicycle shop). The product’s web and mobile apps provide an advanced, user-friendly search experience, offering: - Semantic search using LLMs, allowing users to describe what they need in natural language. - Good filtering options, so users can refine results based on relevant criteria. - Speech-to-text functionality, making it easy for users to speak their queries instead of typing. The goal is to make searching effortless for everyone, whether they are typing, using voice input, or refining results through filters. Simple and Effective Customer Communication The application provides an easy way for customers to contact businesses, ensuring that small service providers do not lose potential customers due to digital complexity. Each business profile includes essential contact details such as phone numbers and email addresses, allowing customers to reach out quickly in a way that suits them best. An optional in-app messaging system allows customers to send quick questions directly through Quack.DG, making it even easier to start a conversation without requiring external tools. However, this remains a choice: businesses can decide whether to allow direct messaging or prefer customers to contact them via traditional methods. User Registration and Accessibility Searching for businesses is open to all users without requiring an account. Anyone can browse available businesses, view their profiles, and access general information. In contrast, saving preferences and receiving personalized updates require users to sign up and create a free account. Businesses must register to create and manage their profiles, including adding business details, updating contact information, and engaging with customers through the platform. Additional Monetization Options for Businesses - Subscription model: Businesses can subscribe to premium features for enhanced visibility or additional tools. - Advertising: Paid promotions or sponsored listings can help businesses stand out. - Exclusive services: Additional features, such as business insights or basic digital business management tools.

43,"Allergy App possible name: Allergone Many people claim that spring is the season of happines - the sun is shining and flowers prosper. However, this means that pollen count is starting as well, making it difficult for allergic people to enjoy this time of renaissance. Our idea is to offer an app for allergic people, in order to overcome this season without annoying disturbances such as runny noses or dizziness. Thus, our app would include features such as tracking the user's mood and the intensity of symptoms over time, allerting the user when certain allergens are in season or reminding them to take their medicine. Furthermore, it could analyse patterns in the allergic person's symptoms to help the user identify its triggers in case an allergy test did not fulfill its requirements or hasn't been made."

47,"Name: LTL AG Problem: A massive problem of modern learning culture is that many simply do not know how to learn correctly. This means that an enormous amount of time is wasted with ineffective methods. Unfortunately, modern techniques are still unknown and would enable learners to save time. Even highly helpful learning groups are still used too rarely. Features: The website offers a text input based on the Chatgpt API. Many prefabricated learning methods are offered, which means that without any entries you can find a learning strategy that is suitable. A more personalized learning strategy can also be developed through specific entries from the user. In addition, people who follow a similar learning method and obtain the same subjects are displayed. To do this, we offer the opportunity to connect to various other apps (Quizlet, Duolingo, Studo, Reddit, etc.) and to incorporate them. Target group: Learners - students, students, further training, etc. Goals and solutions: The aim of this project is to help people create an optimal learning set and find friends. Slogan: Every 10 1/2 minutes there are two people to learn. Learner with Love to Learn"
48,"Project Description Rento is a user-friendly app designed to facilitate the renting and selling of products, with a particular focus on electronics, tools, and services. The platform caters to individuals who need temporary access to items or want to monetize underutilized possessions. In addition to renting products, Rento also allows users to rent services from skilled individuals—whether it's handyman help, tutoring, pet sitting, or other personal services. It serves as an ideal solution for students moving to a new city who may need tools, electronics, or specific services for short-term use, as well as homeowners or renters with occasional items—like lawnmowers or power tools—who want to earn extra income by offering them for rent. The platform also makes it easy to find and rent services from people in your community for any number of tasks, enhancing convenience for everyone. Core Features Peer-to-Peer Marketplace : Users can list items for rent or sale, creating a community-driven marketplace for goods that are not used daily but are expensive to buy outright. Focus on High-Demand Items : The platform emphasizes items such as electronics (laptops, cameras, phones) and tools (drills, lawnmowers, etc.), catering to people who need temporary access to these products without the high upfront cost. Seamless Renting and Selling Experience : The app enables users to easily browse, rent, or purchase items from others within their local community. In addition to standard rentals, users can negotiate the length and cost of the rental directly through the app. Rent Services from Humans : Rento also allows users to rent services from skilled individuals in their community. Whether it's hiring a handyman, a tutor, a pet sitter, or other personal services, users can easily find and book these services within the app, enhancing convenience and providing a flexible way to meet various needs. Token-Based System To further enhance the platform's functionality and encourage user engagement, Rento will introduce a token-based reward system. Tokens are earned when users actively participate in the process, such as delivering or picking up rented items. The more valuable or bulky the item being transferred, the more tokens are awarded. Earning Tokens : Users can accumulate tokens through activities like delivering or picking up rented products, fostering a more robust and engaged community. This system helps reduce the logistical burden often associated with peer-to-peer rentals, providing motivation for users to our services such as delivery. Redeeming Tokens : Tokens can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including small discounts on future rentals or purchases, or even the opportunity to ”rent” or ”buy” other products on the platform. This creates a win-win for both renters and owners, as it lowers the cost of participation and encourages more active involvement in the community."

51,"This project is a portal in which patients can post symptoms/injuries etc. in the form of texts, videos, images and audios anonymously and have certified medical staff. It is intended as a kind of 1450 health telephone only as an app / website. In order to be able to answer as a doctor, a certificate (e.g. doctoral title or inscription at a medical study with sufficient ECTs etc.) is required. Patients can search for symptoms and the first clinical pictures with the respective suggestions for action (e.g. consultation) are displayed. After the first remote diagnosis of the medical personnel, the patient is proposed with contact details in his area if necessary. (e.g. medical personnel recommends to visit hospital; the next hospitals are proposed with opening times)"
52,"Our idea is to create a software that will help to monitor patients with medical conditions. It will be firstly linked to a specific clinic and in future might be sold into others. The app will allow users to insert data about their health from medical devices that are accessible to use from home. For example heartbeat rate, sugar level in blood, blood pressure, temperature etc and also laboratory tests . The whole information in chronological order and also the whole information about patient will be accessible for doctors so they can see how the condition is progressing over last time. It will help them to see if the method of curing the disease is effective and also they will be notified if something is going wrong by the patient.

53,"Our application is intended to improve telephone use for older people by reducing the complexity of modern smartphones. This is realized by creating a launcher that adapted to the requirements and technical knowledge of the user. The large amount of information (unnecessary notifications, extended settings, ...) overwhelms many older users. In order to avoid this, the program should make the homescreen more accessible, integrate filters and a better overview for notifications and give users more security when making decisions through an oncoming approach. With our approach, accessible operation would be available on any common Android device without being limited to specialized ""senior cell phones""."
54,"Sustainable Decentralized Computation Browser / Software With big data centers emerging all over the world to fuel advances for AI, general use or worse, crypto currency, power consumption and environmental strain is at an all-time high. With our project, a browser or application, depending on what makes more sense for the scope (feedback much appreciated!), we would like to provide a step in the right direction - giving users the option to share a percentage of their CPU processing with a central computation unit sending out individual tasks, which barely increases their environmental footprint as power consumption remains basically unchanged while making a big dent in overall power required to achieve the same result worldwide. Apart from reducing the overall footprint, users will be provided with a transparent dashboard that displays how their computing power has been utilized. This ensures more visibilty of how the profits generated from their shared processing power directly support environmental projects. Whether funding, reforestation efforts, or other sustainability initiatives, users can track their impact in real time, reinforcing trust and engagement in a greener future."

If you like the item, you swipe right, if you dislike it, you swipe left. After swiping right, the item is saved to your list of favorites. When scrolling through your list of favorite items, you can decide whether you want to contact the seller or not."
56,"Project idea: Group event Planner app The app should simplify the planning of joint activities and appointments for groups - be it for friends of friends, clubs or work colleagues. The system offers functions such as finding an appointment through surveys, events suggestions, memories and a clear presentation of all planned events in the form of a divisible calendar. In addition to events, trips should also be easily planned - the location and date can also be determined by voting. In addition, information such as a packing list, a program and the costs can be shared via the app. In order for the trip to remain clear, the flight or travel dates can be entered and a clear schedule can be created. At the end of each event or trip, the participants can give feedback to make the next event even better. In addition, an interface is to be provided for other systems to enable compatibility with existing calendars such as Google Calendar or Outlook. This makes integration seamless and user -friendly into personal or professional planning processes."
57,"Our project idea is a social media app in which the focus is not on photos or texts, but on music. The app works according to a principle that resembles the ""Bereal"" app: Once a day, all users are given the opportunity to share the recent song with its friends at a randomly selected time. Only by sharing a song does the user get the opportunity to see the recently played songs played by his friends. The meaning of the app is to offer the individual user a large selection of musicians and songs, which it would never have discovered without the app. Furthermore, the app helps to combine people with similar taste in music and to recognize common interests."

It often happens that a person willing to donate are overwhelmed by the large number of organizations and the registration process. Many also disturbs the elaborate process of canceling an ongoing membership, which is often only possible via direct contact with the respective organization. Since there is a very large selection of aid organizations or donation projects and you could quickly lose track, we would like to develop a program on which donations can be managed easily and centrally. This should also be possible for disposable and acute donations. In order to protect the users from fraud as possible, each participating aid organization must go through a verification process. The possibility of a monthly subscription should also be offered to users, in which all users decide on the allocation of these funds. The management of their members is also to be made possible by the participating organizations via the platform."

Features: # Destination Recommendations We will ask the user to input some information about their budget constraints, interests and past travels and our application will then suggest some destinations that matches their preferences and help them explore new places. # Flight and Hotel Booking In our application we will have partnerships with airlines and accomodation providers, so that users can search and compare prices of flights. All of that will be within the platform for booking. This will make booking much easier for users and it will help them saving time,money and energy by bringing together deals and details. With a seamless booking system integrated directly into the app, users can search for and reserve flights, hotels, restaurants, and rental cars. Users would be able to use the app offline too. # Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tool A lot of travels have the problem to find their gate in airports due to the fact, that airports are really huge and it is mostly complicated to find the necessary gate for the flight. This tool will help users to find their gate faster and easier. It works the same as Google Map. So it will display the route and also have a speaking tool that translate signs into any language. # Travel Updates and Alerts Stay informed about flight statuses and receive emergency alerts directly through the app. Globetracker keeps travellers updated on any disruptions or changes to their itinerary, as well as weather alerts, ensuring a smooth and stress-free travel experience. # Analytics and Insights Users would be gaining valuable insights into travel history and identify opportunities for cost-saving and time optimization. By analysing past trips and expenditures, users can make decisions to improve future travel experiences. # Expense Tracking and Budget Management Globetracker helps users to track their expenses efficiently, monitor invoices, and generate expense reports in real-time. This feature enables travellers to stay within budget and manage finances effectively throughout their journey. # Customizable Trip Organization Users can plan their trips effortlessly by inputting their location and accessing customisable task lists. From booking flights and accommodations to creating packing lists, Globetracker streamlines the entire travel planning process. Additionally, the project entails the development of a web interface with user authentication functionality to complement the mobile application. A server-side process will manage a global database and cater to diverse clients' needs, leveraging existing server infrastructure for integration. Globetracker aims to redefine the travel management landscape by offering a solution that combines convenience, efficiency, and personalisation."

73,"Project Description: GhostChess We would like to present our project idea for the UE Project Management. The project is based on an already existing real start-up idea and a sub-area, which focuses on software, is to be developed over the course of the semester using various taught project management methods. Problem definition Active and professional chess players are particularly familiar with this problem: staring at the screen for hours on end in order to improve at chess. Solution: GhostChess GhostChess brings the advantages of online chess to a real, high-quality wooden chess board. With GhostChess you can play at any time and against anyone in the world on a tangible board that automatically recognizes your moves and transmits them to an online platform such as Lichess or Chess.com. Your opponents' moves are executed directly on the board - as if they were being moved by a ghost. But GhostChess goes even further: it analyzes games, records games with friends or tracks live matches from championships directly on the board. GhostChess combines the best of the digital world with the classic chess experience: on a high-quality wooden board. Project scope in the UE: Development of an app / interface Within the scope of this UE, software is to be developed on the basis of the GhostChess technology that should serve as an interface between the user and the chessboard, connects the board with the online world and makes this interaction accessible via a user-friendly UI. Some features that the project should include ▪ Connection to the GhostChess board (via Bluetooth or WiFi) ▪ Real-time import of the piece position on the physical board into the app ▪ Automatic recording of chess games through continuous synchronization with the board ▪ API integration with Lichess & Chess.com ▪ Playing online chess games in real-time on the GhostChess board ▪ Live streaming of championships or friendly games directly to the board ▪ Chess puzzles and training modes that can be solved directly on the board ▪ etc Business model The monetization concept for the app is still being worked out, but a subscription model is planned. If you would like to learn more about GhostChess and how it bridges the gap between traditional and digital chess, feel free to visit our website or on Instagram:"
