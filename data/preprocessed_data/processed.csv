24,"Globetracker Travel Management Application Project Overview: Globetracker is a travel management application designed to revolutionize the way travelers plan, book, and track their journeys. Our client envisions an iOS and Android application that functions as a one-stop solution for all travel-related tasks, catering to the needs of both leisure and business travellers. The aim of this app is to enable users to easily book a trip from the start to the end, without any difficulties or problems. Users will find everything they need regarding a trip on this application. Below we will describe the features in more detail. Features: # Destination Recommendations We will ask the user to input some information about their budget constraints, interests and past travels and our application will then suggest some destinations that matches their preferences and help them explore new places. # Flight and Hotel Booking In our application we will have partnerships with airlines and accomodation providers, so that users can search and compare prices of flights. All of that will be within the platform for booking. This will make booking much easier for users and it will help them saving time,money and energy by bringing together deals and details. With a seamless booking system integrated directly into the app, users can search for and reserve flights, hotels, restaurants, and rental cars. Users would be able to use the app offline too. # Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tool A lot of travels have the problem to find their gate in airports due to the fact, that airports are really huge and it is mostly complicated to find the necessary gate for the flight. This tool will help users to find their gate faster and easier. It works the same as Google Map. So it will display the route and also have a speaking tool that translate signs into any language. # Travel Updates and Alerts Stay informed about flight statuses and receive emergency alerts directly through the app. Globetracker keeps travellers updated on any disruptions or changes to their itinerary, as well as weather alerts, ensuring a smooth and stress-free travel experience. # Analytics and Insights Users would be gaining valuable insights into travel history and identify opportunities for cost-saving and time optimization.
