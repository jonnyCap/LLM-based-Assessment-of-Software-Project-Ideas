Okay, so I need to summarize the feedback given for our discount finder app project. Let me start by reading through all these comments carefully. 

First, most feedback mentions the idea is innovative and has good potential, especially with the added feature of calculating gasoline costs. That's a big plus because it makes the app more practical for real-life use. People like that they can compare discounts from different supermarkets and even see how much gas would cost when crossing stores.

But some comments also point out that there are existing apps similar to ours, which means we need to make our app stand out somehow. Maybe by partnering with specific supermarkets or adding personalized features could help differentiate us.

The feedback on strengths includes the idea being novel and useful for many users, especially those who shop a lot and value discounts. However, the weaknesses noted are things like limited market potential because not everyone shops frequently enough to use this app. Also, there's some worry about competition from similar apps.

Recommendations vary. Some suggest focusing on core functionality first before adding more features, others mention data acquisition and algorithm development as key areas to work on. There’s also a suggestion to consider user reviews for discounts or integrating loyalty programs.

Looking at all the points together, it seems the app has a solid foundation but needs refining in terms of completeness—more detail is needed on how we'll get discounts, calculate gas costs, handle edge cases like out-of-stock items, and ensure data security. Also, addressing competition by adding unique features or expanding to more areas could help.

I should structure this summary to highlight the main strengths: innovation, usefulness, potential market appeal, and applicability in a course setting. Then, mention the key recommendations about focusing on core functionality, gathering more data sources, developing algorithms, user interface details, and considering partnerships for differentiation.
